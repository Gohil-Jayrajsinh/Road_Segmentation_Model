## 📊 Results

The model was trained and evaluated using YOLOv8 on a dataset of 8,000 road images. Below are the key performance metrics and sample outputs:

### 🏆 Performance Metrics:

- **Precision:** 0.88 (The percentage of correctly predicted road pixels out of all pixels labeled as roads by the model)
- **Recall:** 0.92 (The percentage of actual road pixels correctly identified by the model)
- **mAP@0.5:** 0.89 (Mean Average Precision at IoU threshold of 0.5)


These metrics demonstrate the model’s high accuracy and efficiency, making it highly suitable for real-world road segmentation applications.

### 📊 Visual Results

The following samples illustrate the model's performance on real-world roads:
